    title: "The Unbroken",
    description: `While some humans believed Zombie beings were the ultimate fighting tool, others wanted to fuse themselves with machines to gain added strength, while remaining of human mind. The Unbroken were a splinter group who adapted the Cyborg technology to bind human flesh to the machine technology. This worked at first, and almost superhuman strength was achieved. But it was not without a flaw. A toxin was released from the mechanical exoskeleton causing a harmful and debilitating reaction. So time was an issue and the window for operation, short. The Unbroken needed to return to life support or would be overwhelmed physically and mentally.`,
