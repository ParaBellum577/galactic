After a series of natural disasters on their new planet, the Aliens were forced to use an ancient teleportation device to bring them back.

His guerilla group managed to recover the research papers and DNA of the project which he continued to work on whilst recruiting more and more lost souls into his cult of death.  His suiside mission to release the virus into society was partially foiled by the wormhole caused by Jupiterâ€™s Knights. Instead of killing the humans, it turned them into a race of living dead, their veins swollen and radioactive. `,

But it was not without a flaw. A toxin was released from the mechanical exoskeleton causing a harmful and debilitating reaction. So time was an issue and the window for operation, short.
